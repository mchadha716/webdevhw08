I tried to deploy to events.mirawebdev.xyz but I wasn't able to deploy :(

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

My app is nearly completely functional, it's missing the functionality to send emails to the people invited, and the rsvp (yes/maybe/no) functionality is there but doesn't display properly

No - I had a lot of trouble trying to re-deploy, I kept getting an error saying that the node already existed.
